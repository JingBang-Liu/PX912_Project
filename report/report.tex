\section{The non-uniform solver}

\subsection{Non-uniform Grid Generator}

Here we only show the non-uniform grid generator in $1D$ case.

Suppose the thin film starts at point $x_{start}$ and ends at point $x_{end}$. Assume that initial shape of the thin film is symmetric about the centre. Then we know that the shape of the thin film should always be symmetric and the model predicted rupture point should be also positioned at the centre. So it is reasonable that the non-uniform grid is also symmetric about the centre with a high grid density around the centre.

With the above in mind, we generate the grid with following formula.

\begin{align}
	y_i &= 
\end{align}
